This web application is done for my internship at CRS Soft. It is a user-friendly time management web application developed using ASP.NET and C#, with a responsive frontend built on Razor Pages with HTML, CSS, and C#. For the backend, utilized JavaScript for enhanced functionality and utilized SQL for efficient data storage. Users can create and make changes on live shared timetable web application.
